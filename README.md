# DesignDetective

## Synopsis:
A browser extension, available on Chromium and Mozilla based browser, written in JavaSript, HTML and CSS, that use AI to return the font and hexadecimal values of colors used on a website.

## Project:
I am attending Harvard's CS50x online classes and need to create a final project, in order to pass my degree.
I used to be streaming games / creating video games content, and this is a sentence that i would repeat a lot: "Hey this website as a cool design philosophy, the font is pretty nice and the are to my liking. I could use them on my Overlays, Twitch banner, etc..."
But not everyone knows how to, (or want to), get through the web inspector and down a CSS file. So i had the idea of creating a web extension for the creative minds out there that don't want to mess with there browser settings: DesignDetective.

DesignDetective will be using TensorFlow.js official libs, some basic javascript functions and HTML + CSS. No account needed, no servers, nor cookies collecting data... Straight up returning website fonts and hexadecimals for the colors used.

## Limitation:
Keep in mind that this project is only meant to be runned one time by the Harvard's CS50x staff. Since i am limited to 100 API calls a day, per user, using the TensoFlow.js free tier, i would have to limit each users to 10 or 20 API calls a day.

## How to participate: 
pull to the second branch !
'devel-2' is for all devs out there, who want to contribute to the project. 'devel-1' is my branch. I will surely try to expand the project further, because there is so much potential to me. For now, in order to respect Academy honesty and my assgnement rules, i will not accept pull request, nor used any outside help: I need to pulled the basic web extension of all alone.
For the future, i would love to train my own AI model, host it on a server, and use it to replace TensorFlow AI. For now though, let's code this web extension!
